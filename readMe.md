Age Counter by Taylor Walker

This age counter counts how long it has been since I was born (14th April 2004) right down to the millisecond, it then orginises the data into a better format with years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
This age counter also accounts to leap years aswell as when during the year that my birthday would be and when the current date is.
